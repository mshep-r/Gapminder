## Introduction
In this document, we will be exploring the Gapminder dataset. 


## Observations of Gapminder

### Countries with life expectancy less than 30

```{r}
filter(gapminder,lifeExp<30)
```


We see two countries, Afghanistan and Rwanda.  We see 6 columns (country, continent, year, lifeExp, pop, gdpPercap)

---

### Countries with life expectancy greater than 81

```{r}
filter(gapminder,lifeExp>81)
```

We see a couple of countries appear **twice**, *HK* and *Japan*.

---

### Life Expectancy by continent in 2007


```{r}
gapminder2 <- gapminder %>% filter(gapminder$year==2007)
boxplot(lifeExp~continent,data=gapminder2)
```

Gosh I **suck** at this! I finally see a plot.  Africa lowest overall, and widest spread.
